# rss-please

Tiny Deno server that scrapes some websites and return a RSS feed of it. You probably don't wanna use this, there's already [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub), [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) and a billion other solutions. I just needed something simple and a fun project to play with [Deno](https://deno.land/) ðŸ˜€
